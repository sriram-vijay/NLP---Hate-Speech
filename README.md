# End-to-end-NLP-Project-Implementation

This NLP project is based on the identification of hate speech. The model makes predictions about whether a given string is hate speech or not when it is entered.

The project employs two methods.

First, TF-IDF vectorizer is used for feature engineering, followed by training and prediction using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Linear SVC models.

Second, Keras embedding layer is utilized for feature engineering, with an LSTM model used for training and prediction.
